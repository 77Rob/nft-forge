# NFT Forge

## Welcome to the world of generative NFT collections! Bring your NFT vision to life with a tool that makes it easy to generate art for and create NFT collections.

In this project, images in a generative NFT collection are constructed from different traits that can be combined and blended to create unique, one-of-a-kind NFTs. Think of it as building an NFT from the ground up, piece by piece. For example, a cryptopunk picture might be a combination of 5 different image layers, such as a hat, cigar, body, glasses, beard, and earrings.

With this project, you can use the API to create and manage your own NFT collections. You can create new collections and add, update, or delete image layers to build the appearance of your NFT. Once you're happy with your creation, you can upload the images and metadata to IPFS to ensure that your NFT is securely stored in a decentralized manner. Finally, you can use the API to deploy a smart contract that represents your NFT and makes it tradeable and collectible.

In addition to the API, the project also provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to create and manage NFT collections. With a simple, intuitive interface, you can preview your generated art, add, update, or delete image layers, upload images and metadata to IPFS, and deploy smart contracts with just a few clicks.

Whether you're a seasoned blockchain developer or just starting out, the user interface makes it easy to get started with NFTs and experience the excitement of creating unique, collectible digital assets. So go ahead and try it out, and see what kind of amazing NFT collections you can create!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

<!-- For mantle hackathon. I'm building a tool that will allow people to easily generate art, metadata and smart contracts for minting NFTs on Mantle testnet, where the image is uploaded to IPFS. First user creates a collection within it the nfts will be created by providing different layers of images(traits) then generating images by stacking on to each other after that user can upload the collection and metadata to ipfs and use next.js app to make and deploy smart contract. Give me some ideas on how should i design website. The tool will allow people to easily create and mint NFTs on Mantle testnet, where the image is uploaded to IPFS. Give me example for page and route layout for this project. It should include Landing page, Page where user can see all of his collections pages for generating art, metadata and uploading data to ipfs for collections and page with smart contract wizzard where user can create smart contracts after he already generated all the art uploaded it to ipfs and generated metadata and uploaded it to ipfs contract wizzard should be similar to "https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/". -->
